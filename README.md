# Nieve
Nieve is a website that I am developing to help educate people from an underpriviliged background and give anyone the knowledge to succesfully tackle any debt. As a young adult I was introduced to the idea of being able to purchase things with credit or loans and it quickly got out of control. I would like to share the methods I used to overcome this with anyone. My goal for Nieve is to share tools with anyone and best finance practices and one day work with other organizations to provide free financial education for anyone of any background.

Debt consolidation tool where you can add acounts and users to provide you with a strategy to eliminate your debt through the snowball method. The snowball method will identify your smallest account balances first and pay those off and then move on to your larger balances.

I currently have CRUD functions in my Nieve database and used Spring Boot as the framework.
